First Milestone Project
-----------------------
This is my first milestone project that I'll be completing as part of my Fullstack Developer course with Code Institute.
The brief is to create a static (front-end only) website for a band, specifically for the Monkees, an American pop rock band that rose to fame on the 60s.


-----------------------
UX
-----------------------
The brief for this project is to create a site to showcase music and video clips of the band's back catalog.
As well as to publicise the band's availability to perform at events like weddings, or Christmas parties.

Features
-----------------------
The features I'm looking to implement include:
-A single, scrolling page with distinct sections.
-A Navigation bar that remain near the top of the webpage's viewport.
-Social Media links embedded in the sticking navbar.
-A Landing section to both ease the viewer into the website, while also making clear what it is about.
-A Video section to showcase the band's performance ability
-A Gallery/About section that provides further details about the band members
-An Audio section to showcase even more audio samples from the band's catalog
-A Contact form for bookings or other queries.

Features Left to Implement
-Sticking Navigation bar to top of viewport
-social media links
-video section

Technologies Used

I will also be using the Bootstrap framework to simplify the layout of the website:

Testing
-----------------------
Discovered that landing background image was not working correctly as the style.css file was improperly referenced in the index.html file.
