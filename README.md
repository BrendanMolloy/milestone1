First Milestone Project
-----------------------
This is my first milestone project that I'll be completing as part of my Fullstack Developer course with Code Institute.
The brief is to create a static (front-end only) website for a band, specifically for the Monkees, an American pop rock band that rose to fame on the 60s.


-----------------------
UX
-----------------------
The brief for this project is to create a site to showcase music and video clips of the band's back catalog.
As well as to publicise the band's availability to perform at events like weddings, or Christmas parties.

Features
-----------------------
The features I'm looking to implement include:
-A single, scrolling page with distinct sections.
-A Navigation bar that remains fixed to the top of the webpage's viewport.
-Social Media links embedded in the navbar.
-A Landing section to both ease the viewer into the website, while also making clear what it is about.
-A Video section to showcase the band performing
-A Gallery/About section that provides further details about the band members
-An Audio section to showcase even more audio samples from the band's catalog
-A Contact form for bookings or other queries.

Features Left to Implement
-video in video section actually plays
-gallery with more images and a modal
-shadow effect behind images in gallery
-contact form verbage
-reactive elements such as social media links changing colors on hover
-fonts
-backgrounds

Another feature idea

I will also be using the Bootstrap framework to simplify the layout of the website:

Discovered that landing background image was not working correctly as the style.css file was improperly referenced in the index.html file.
Video player no longer breaks alignment at smaller resolutions

Known Bugs:

navbar elements jumping to odd places for the linked sections
