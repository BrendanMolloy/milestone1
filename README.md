First Milestone Project
-----------------------
This is my first milestone project that I'll be completing as part of my Fullstack Developer course with Code Institute.
The brief is to create a static (front-end only) website for a band, specifically for the Monkees, an American pop rock band that rose to fame in the 60s.


-----------------------
UX
-----------------------
The brief for this project is to create a site to showcase music and video clips of the band's back catalog.
As well as to publicise the band's availability to perform at events like weddings, or Christmas parties.

User Stories:-
As a fan I want images of the band so that I can see more of its members.
As a fan of 60s music I want audio clips of the band's back catalog so that I can find out if I like their music
As a fan I want to contact the band so that I can ask more about bookings

Wireframes:-
all done in pen and paper

Features
-----------------------
The features I've implemented include:
-A single, scrolling page with distinct sections.
-A Navigation bar that remains fixed to the top of the webpage's viewport.
-Social Media links embedded in the navbar.
-A Landing section to both ease the viewer into the website, while also making clear what it is about.
-A Video section to showcase the band performing
-A Gallery/About section that provides further details about the band members
-A modal to offer a more focused view of the images found in the gallery
-An Audio section to showcase even more audio samples from the band's catalog
-A Contact form for bookings or other queries.
-Clickable elements are reactive and further draw attention to theselves to acknowledge interactability
-A font inspired by the 60s
-Background images that showcase more of the band

Another feature idea
-Fictional Tour Dates

-----------------------
Technologies Used
-----------------------
This project used HTML5 and CSS3 languages.
I also used the Bootstrap framework to simplify the layout of the website:

Testing
-----------------------
Resolved Issues:
Discovered that landing background image was not working correctly as the style.css file was improperly referenced in the index.html file.
Video player no longer breaks alignment at smaller resolutions
video from repository exceeded 8MB in size preventing its rendering; opted to use a link to a corresponding youtube video
Images in modal no longer extend past edge of screen
Thumbnails in modal no longer overlap

Known Bugs:
navbar occludes section headings when jumped to the associated link
